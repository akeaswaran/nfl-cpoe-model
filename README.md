NFL CPOE Model
---

This is a Python translation of the expected completion percentage model built into [nflfastR](https://github.com/mrcaseb/nflfastR). All credit goes to the creators of nflfastR, Ben Baldwin and Sebastian Carl.

I've also dumped the model as a CoreML model for use on iOS devices.

This code isn't commented particularly well; use at your own risk.
